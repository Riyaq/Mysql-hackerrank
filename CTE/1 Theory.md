1. What is a Common Table Expression (CTE)? How is it different from a subquery?
   ```
   A CTE is a temporary result set defined using the WITH keyword that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
   *Readability: CTEs make complex queries more readable.

   *Reusability: You can reference a CTE multiple times within the same query (unlike subqueries).

   *Recursion: CTEs support recursive operations, subqueries donâ€™t.
   ```
