## 1. SQL Basics (Foundations)

Data Types (INT, VARCHAR, DATE, etc.)

-CRUD operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT)

Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, LIKE, IN, IS NULL)

Sorting & limiting (ORDER BY, LIMIT/TOP)

## 2. Joins & Relationships

Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, Full Join

Self Joins

Understanding Primary Key & Foreign Key

Many-to-many relationships via junction tables

## 3. Aggregations & Grouping

Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN)

GROUP BY & HAVING

Rollup & Cube (for hierarchical/grouped summaries)

## 4. Subqueries & Derived Tables

Scalar subqueries

Correlated subqueries

EXISTS vs IN

Derived tables (subqueries in FROM)

## 5. Advanced SQL Concepts

Window Functions (Ranking, Running Totals, Moving Averages)

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) â€“ recursive and non-recursive

Pivot & Unpivot (cross-tab reporting)

Case expressions (CASE WHEN)

## 6. Views & Stored Programs

Views (virtual tables)

Materialized views (in some databases)

Stored Procedures & Functions

Triggers

## 7. Performance Tuning

Indexing (Clustered, Non-Clustered, Composite, Covering indexes)

Execution plans & query optimization

Normalization vs Denormalization trade-offs

Partitioning & Sharding (for very large datasets)

## 8. Transactions & Concurrency

ACID properties

COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

Isolation levels (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable)

Deadlocks & Locking mechanisms

## 9. Security & Data Governance

GRANT / REVOKE permissions

Row-level security

Masking sensitive data

## 10. Practical, Real-World Skills

Writing clean & reusable SQL queries

Handling NULL values properly

Debugging & validating results

Working with large datasets (millions of rows)

Integrating SQL with BI tools (Power BI, Tableau)

Writing SQL for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines
