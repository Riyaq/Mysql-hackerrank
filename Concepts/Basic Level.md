    PARTITION BY department_id
    ORDER BY salary DESC
  ) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;
```
### Question 2
Get the Highest Salary per Department:
Show all employees, and use a window function to flag those with the highest salary in their department.

CASE when 
     salary = max(salary) over(partition by department_id)
     then "Highest"
     else " "
     end as is_highest_salary
from employee
```
### Question 3

  LAG(salary) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department_id
    ORDER BY salary
