 <br>
   
  | emp_id | emp_name | department | salary |
| ------- | --------- | ---------- | ------ |
| 1       | Alice     | HR         | 60000  |
| 2       | Bob       | HR         | 55000  |
| 3       | Charlie   | HR         | 60000  |
| 4       | David     | IT         | 75000  |
| 5       | Eva       | IT         | 70000  |
| 6       | Frank     | IT         | 70000  |
| 7       | Grace     | Finance    | 80000  |

Code -
```sql
SELECT
  emp_id,
  emp_name,
  department,
  salary,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM
  employees;
```
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Find Top N Salaries per Department
Using the same employees table, find the top 2 highest-paid employees from each department.

**Solution 1**
```sql
WITH ranked_employees AS (
  SELECT emp_id, emp_name, department, salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
  FROM employees
)
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, department, salary
FROM ranked_employees
WHERE salary_rank <= 2;
```
**Solution 2**
```sql
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, department, salary
FROM (
  SELECT emp_id, emp_name, department, salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
  FROM employees
) AS ranked
WHERE salary_rank <= 2;
```

3. Find First Purchase Date per Customer
In a purchases table with columns customer_id, purchase_date, and amount, get each customerâ€™s first purchase date using ROW_NUMBER().

| customer\_id | purchase\_date | amount |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------ |
| 101          | 2024-01-01     | 100    |
| 101          | 2024-01-05     | 150    |
| 102          | 2024-01-03     | 200    |
| 102          | 2024-01-02     | 50     |
| 103          | 2024-01-04     | 300    |

```SQL
SELECT
  customer_id,
  purchase_date,
  amount
FROM (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    purchase_date,
    amount,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY customer_id
      ORDER BY purchase_date
    ) AS rn
  FROM purchases
) AS ranked
WHERE rn = 1;

```
