Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! <br>
Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and name of hackers who achieved full scores for more than one challenge. <br>
Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which the hacker earned a full score.<br>
If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending hacker_id.<br>

*** Observation ***
Here is total 4 table and I have to work with all the table at once.<br>
Hence I will use INNER JOIN here to build connection/ JOIN with all four table.<br>
